## Features

A user-friendly database interface created to be connected to a Museum database, which stores data from artists, exhibitions and more. Connected to MySQL Database Management System through Python connector, this interface is capable to perform the INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW and ALTER SQL commands as well as retrieve data by using basic to intermediate QUERY commands.

## Organization

- Code folder:
  - Contains your main python application code
- Sql scripts folder:
  - Contains all sql scripts required (database creation and initialization, sql script with query tasks in the handout, etc...)
- Database design folder:
  - EERD and Relational Schema
- Optional data folder:
  - Has data files that you can sue to load data to your application if you use this optional implementation requirement

## TASK ASSIGNEMENT

- Database design:
  - Creation of EER Diagram based on the provided requirements narrative, description of design decisions and assumptions and mapping of the conceptual schema into a Relational Model.
- Database creation:
  - Creation of a .sql script from the Relational Model and creation of Query Code.
- Python Application:
  - Implementation of an application that connects the database to be used for data browsing, entery and etc.

## Built With

This project was built using the following technologies:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - high-level, general-purpose programming language.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) - open-source relational database management system.
- [MySQL Connector/Python](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/) - enables Python programs to access MySQL databases, using an API that is compliant with the Python Database API Specification v2. 0 (PEP 249).
- [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) - visual database design tool that integrates SQL development, administration, database design, creation and maintenance into a single integrated development environment for the MySQL database system
- [Git Version Control](https://git-scm.com/) - free and open source software for distributed version control.
